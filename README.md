# Boba-Catch
A cute catch game where you try to catch as much falling boba in your tea as you can, but watch out for the creepy crawlers! Score increases the more boba you catch in a row, earning you a streak bonus that resets when you miss one. Don't catch too many crawlers or else it's game over!

## Bugs
- Sizing of text elements and buttons on smaller screens expands beyond the game container.
- The creepy crawlers are sized smaller than intended. Hard to see on some screen dimensions.
