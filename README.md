# Boba-Catch
A cute catch game where you try to catch as much falling boba in your tea as you can, but watch out for the creepy crawlers! Score increases the more boba you catch in a row, earning you a streak bonus that resets when you miss one. Don't catch too many crawlers or else it's game over! 



## Bugs
Currently trying to resolve a bug where the falling boba interval does not properly stop when the game ends from catching more than 3 crawlers.
